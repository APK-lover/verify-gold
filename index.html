    <p>Expert Guidance by Umar Jewellers</p>

    <p>Gold is not just a symbol of luxury in Pakistan—it’s a trusted form of investment and a cherished part of our traditions. But whether you’re buying for a wedding, a gift, or as a long-term asset, verifying gold purity before you make the purchase is crucial. At <strong>Umar Jewellers</strong>, we believe in empowering customers with the right knowledge so they can make confident and safe choices.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gold Purity & Karats</h2>
    <p>Gold purity is measured in <strong>karats (K)</strong>, with 24K being pure gold. In Pakistan, <strong>22K gold</strong> is the most popular choice for both bridal and investment jewelry. Here’s what each karat means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>24K</strong> – Pure gold, soft and malleable, mostly used for coins and bars.</li>
        <li><strong>22K</strong> – 91.6% pure gold, perfect for fine jewelry.</li>
        <li><strong>21K</strong> – 87.5% pure, common in certain ornaments.</li>
        <li><strong>18K</strong> – 75% pure, often used in intricate designs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Look for Hallmark Certification</h2>
    <p>The easiest way to confirm gold purity is to check for a <strong>hallmark stamp</strong>. This stamp, issued by authorized bodies, verifies that the gold content matches the karat value claimed. Umar Jewellers ensures every gold piece is hallmarked and certified for authenticity.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Tip:</strong> Always ask the jeweller for the gold certificate and verify the hallmark under a magnifying glass for clarity.
    </div>

    <h2>Use a Magnet Test (Quick Check)</h2>
    <p>Pure gold is not magnetic. If your jewelry is attracted to a magnet, it may contain other metals. While this is not a definitive test, it’s a good quick check before a purchase.</p>

    <h2>Acid Test for Serious Buyers</h2>
    <p>Professional jewellers, including Umar Jewellers, use an <strong>acid test</strong> to confirm gold purity. This involves applying a small drop of nitric acid to the gold’s surface to check its reaction. Only experienced professionals should perform this test to avoid damage.</p>

    <h2>Why Buy from Umar Jewellers?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Guaranteed certified and hallmarked gold.</li>
        <li>Transparent pricing based on daily market rates.</li>
        <li>Decades of trust in the Pakistani jewelry market.</li>
        <li>Specialization in both bridal and investment-grade jewelry.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Advice for Buyers</h2>
    <p>Before investing in gold, always research market prices, verify purity through a certified jeweller, and keep all purchase receipts safe. Choosing a trusted source like <strong>Umar Jewellers</strong> ensures you’re getting exactly what you pay for—authentic, high-quality gold.</p>
